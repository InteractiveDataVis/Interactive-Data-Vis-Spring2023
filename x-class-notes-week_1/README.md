# Section 1 | Tutorial 3 | Introduction to JS

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to introduce interactivity into our websites.
- to learn the basics of javascript, including types, `let` and `const`, scoping, functions, and DOM manipulation.
- to understand [buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), and how to assign functions to respond to their activity.

## Assignment:

- [ ] Create a page that counts the number of times a user has clicked a button. This should include an HTML button (`<button>`) and a counter display (this can be anything, like a `<div>`). This should do the following:
  - [ ] The page starts with 0 in the counter display. 
  - [ ] The button runs an `onclick` function that updates the number in the counter.
  - **HINT:** you can either store the value in your javascript using `let`, or you can get the current value (`counter.innerText`) in order to add one to it. If you are getting a long string of numbers, check your [types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#data_structures_and_types). 
- [ ] Push these changes up to your forked repository. You should see your commit and any code changes in the github repo. Confirm that you see your changes in the deployed site. Follow the details outlined in the [deploy and submit below](#deploy--submit) to recieve credit.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Use multiple inputs to get more than one piece of information, and save it in an [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object). 
- [ ] Add a javascript library to your page, like d3.js, and play with the functions. 

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. **NOTE**: It can take up to 10 minutes for pushed up code to appear in a deployed site. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data73200Spring2023.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your committed code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
