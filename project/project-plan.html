    <h1>Project Plan</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href='project-prospective.html'>project prospectus</a> listed a 
      number of methods for exploring the causes of Utah's population growth 
      as measured by the 2020 census. As a student project to be done at the end
      of a semester, I've limited the scope and  approach to fit the related 
      time constraints.
    </p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      In order to potentially explain the state's growth as a result of the 
      effects of public safety, proximity to natural recreation, and possible 
      religious community changes would require the requisition of datasets in 
      beyond the census. Knowing my own proclivities to get lost in research,
      I decided to limit my visualizations to 2022 census data. 
    </p>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a graph to demonstrate the growth of Utah over the period of the
        census.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design graphs showing the types of migrants by where they lived before
        moving to Utah. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            By categories like 'from abroad', 'from another state', and 
            'internal growth'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrate the US regions/subregions from which people are 
            migrating to Utah.
          </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Visualize some comparisons of Utah with other fast growing states, and 
        determine if the general migration patterns match or differ from UT.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Viz arch</h2>
    <p>
      I'd love to have each visualization be navigable in sequence within the same
      web page.
    </p>
    <h3>Implementation focus</h3>
    <p>
      My focus is on presenting the data visualizations in a polished way, with 
      appropriate transitions/animations, meaningful interactions, intelligent
      presentation of information. As a consequence, the graphs made be 
      relatively straight forward.
    </p>
    <h3>A note on data processing</h3>
    <p>
      Outside of a couple small categorical enrichments and some clean up done 
      on Kaggle, I am using data furnished by the 2020 US census survey. I am 
      not manipulating data outside of Javascript. The reason for this is that 
      I'm confortable transforming data via other methods for analytics from 
      previous job experience. Instead, I wanted to process the data using 
      Javascript to become more familiar with some JS data structures and 
      casting between them. My goal is to become more proficient in Javascript.
