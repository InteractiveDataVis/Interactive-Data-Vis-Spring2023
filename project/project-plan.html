    <h1>Project Plan</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href='project-prospective.html'>project prospectus</a> listed a 
      number of methods for exploring the causes of Utah's population growth 
      as measured by the 2020 census. As a student project to be done at the end
      of a semester, I've limited the scope and  approach to fit the related 
      time constraints.

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      In order to potential explain the state's growth as a result of the 
      effects of public safety, proximity to natural recreation, and possible 
      religious community changes would require the requisition of datasets in 
      beyond the census. Knowing my own proclivities to get lost in research,
      I decided to limit my visualizations to 2022 census data.
