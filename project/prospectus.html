    <h1>Project Prospectus</h1>
    <p>
      After proposing an initial project related to the proximity of water 
      to economic and social activity, and finding that potentially difficult
      to source in census data, here are new notes for a prospectus about Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did start compiling information about Guam as an interesting case 
      study. However, census data is more limited for this US territory, and 
      given the semester timeline, I didn't feel I'd do justice to the island.
    </p>
    <h2>Phase 1: Ideate</h2>
    <p>I don't know that much about Utah, and have only been there once to 
      visit friends in Salt Lake City. But Utah has been the 
      <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2021/08/12/new-census-numbers-are/">
      fastest growing state</a> over the last decade. While it may be easy to
      explain away the state's growth with stereotypes about Moron family size
      , I want to explore addtional reasons for population growth in this 
      dynamic state.
    </p>
    <h3>Internal migration</h3>
    <p>
      There may be a story about internal migration within the US to explain
      population growth in Utah.
    </p>
    <h3>A diversifying population</h3>
    <p>
      While Utah is one of the whiter states, the 2020 census, 
      nearly a quarter of the population is non-white. In Salt Lake City, the 
      most populous part of Utah, the percentage of residents who are 
      non-white went from 26% in 2010 to 32.4% in 2020.
    </p>
    <h3>Migration to cities</h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps we can see the general trend of migration from rural to urban as 
      operating in Utah.
    </p>
    <h3>Economic opportunities</h3>
    <p>
      Utah's flat corporate tax could make it more appealing for small 
      business development
    </p>
    <h3>Other potential themes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing growth at a time of national stagnation</li>
      <li>Proximity to natural recreation</li>
      <li>Public safety</li>
      <li>Role of the church in civil society and social programs</li>
      <li>Migration from Mexico</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Phase 2: Develop</h2>
    <p>
      The approach of the project would mostly be exploratory. I expect that 
      the following approach will be made to try to contextualize Utah's 
      population growth.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Comparisons could be made between the state and others that
        have experienced growth over the same period of time. This could help 
        explain larger trends for which Utah is the most concentrated version
      </li>
      <li>
        Comparisons between Utah and the states shrinking the most in 
        population. This approach could contrast policy valences, and attempt
        to pull together some interesting correlations with the approach above.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do time series analysis of census data for the state, which could
        demonstrate the rate of growth in recent decades.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a map that explains population changes over time at a more 
        granular level than the state itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple research behind potential causes for population growth and 
        related data sets could be include to enhance census data.
      </li>
    </ol>
