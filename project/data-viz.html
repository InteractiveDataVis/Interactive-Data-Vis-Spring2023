      <h1>Visualizing Utah's Population Growth</h1>
      <p>
        This page visualizes Utah's growth relatively to other
        states' growth rates between 2010 - 2019 based off of census data. 
        It also illustrates the originating nations of migrants to states of 
        interest (US vs. Abroad), and a breakdown of US states from which 
        migrants are moving to Utah during the time period of the 2020 US Census
         Results.
      </p>

      <h2>Which US states grew fastest and slowest?</h2>
      <p>
        To put Utah's growth over 2010 - 2019 in perspective, it has both the 
        highest growth rate and the highest population increase of the top five
        fastest growing states (Idaho, Texas, North Dakota and Neveda). The rate
        of growth of these states is contrasted by the Pennsylvania, the slowest
        growing states of the 2020 census, and three shrinking states with a
        negative growth rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the graph below, you can hover of the bars to get both the growth 
        rate and population change for each of the states of interest. At risk 
        of stating the obvious, having  a higher growth rate does not mean that 
        other states with lower rates had a smaller population growth in terms 
        of population size; see Texas and Pennsylvania for examples.

      <h2>Migration from abroad v. other states</h2>
      <p>
        With general perceptions about global and US birth rates and migration,
        it would be interesting to investigate the data for both fast and slow/
        negative growth. Are there correlations that could suggestion:
        <ol>
          <li>That populations with high rates of growth are fueled by 
            migration from outside the US?
          </li>
          <li>
            Conversely, are internal migrants from other US states contributing 
            to faster growing states relative increase in size?
          </li>
          <li>
            Could it be the case that slower or shrinking states have more
            foreign born migration?
          </li>
          <li>
            Etc.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <div id="stacked-container"></div>
      <p>
        Hovering over the stacked bar chart above reveals a muddy picture with 
        which to answers these questions. Of the fastest growing states, Texas
        shows the most migration from abroad at 28% of migrants, but  
        20% or more of Pennsylvania and Illinois incoming population is
        another country. Both fast growing (Idaho, North Dakota) and 
        shrinking states (Mississippi, West Virgina) have 10% or less of their
        migrant pool coming from outside the US.

      <h2>Which states are people leaving to settle in Utah?</h2>
      <p>
        The chart below is a circle pack, with each circle representing a state.
        The size of the each circle is proportional to the number of migrants 
        from state to Utah. The graph can be toggled to a color coding by region
        or division (see Census regions and division in data sources below). 
      </p>
      <div id="circle-pack-container"></div>
      <button id="toggle-color-scheme">Color Code by Division</button>
      <p>
        While viewing this chart coding by region, we can see that most new 
        Utahns come from the West, with the South coming in second place.
        When coding color by division, one of the more interesting findings is
        that the number of migratns from states to Utah in the West is composed of 
        roughly equal parts larger population states in the Pacific division, 
        and less densely populated Mountain states.
