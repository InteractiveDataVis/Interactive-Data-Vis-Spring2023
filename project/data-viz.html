      <h1>Visualizing Utah's Population Growth</h1>
      <p>
        This page visualizes Utah's growth relatively to other
        states' growth rates between 2010 - 2019 based off of census data. 
        It also illustrates the originating nations of migrants to states of 
        interest (US vs. Abroad), and a breakdown of US states from which 
        migrants are moving to Utah during the time period of the 2020 US Census
         Results.

      <h2>Overview of Fastest / Slowest Growing US states</h2>

      <p>
        It's not an unreasonable assumption that if Utah was the fastest growing
        state in the US (18.4% growth from 2010-2019), that it would be 
        the result of large size in Mormon families within the state. Turns out
        that might not be entirely accurate.
