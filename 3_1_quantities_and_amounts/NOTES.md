INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
- What went easier than expected?
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial

- One question I have is where we should declare and draw the axes. 
I started off declaring them and drawing in the `draw()`, but that would mean
that they would be re-drawn everytime the function is called. That could be
helpful if interactivity changed the domains of the x or y scale, but maybe
not in this case? Is there a best practice?

- Again, drawing the axes has placed me in a state of confusion. I've tried
labeling the axis to reason about why they're goofy. In trying to fix the
spacing, I've confused the positioning of the rects again.

- OK, I tried to get too fancy when assiging the `y` attribute. I can't tell you
why, but I got that settled. Next, the rects and yAxis are positioned too far
to the left. Let's address that next.

- Elements are displaying enough to be legible. I'm struggling with reasoning
about why the xAxis and yAxis don't meet. I'm going to leave that for a review,
because most of the ideas I have for changing this seem to make the code more 
convoluted. I want to focus on the rest of the assignment at this point.
