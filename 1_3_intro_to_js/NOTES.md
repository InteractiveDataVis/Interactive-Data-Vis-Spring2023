This bonus exercise from 1_2 and 1_3 made me realize that I struggle with two
concepts:

- viewBox
- positioning in general (see upside down barchart)

I think the top to right positioning is getting me confused. 

But I actually did  this pretty well on line 45 of `main.js`. 

Turns out I had a typo in my field names, which made the bars confused about 
my y data while I was drawing them. 

As for viewBox, I'll likely need to experiment and read more. 

I also didn't get to creating an object from user input, and may not have time
to do it for this assignment.
