I think the top to right positioning got me confused for a bit. 

But I actually handled this pretty well on line 45 of `main.js`. 

Turns out I had a typo in my field names, which made the bars confused about 
my y data while I was drawing them. 

If I were to continue on work this chart, I would want to improve legibility,
especially for the party labels.

I also didn't get to creating an object from user input, and may not have time
to do it before this assignment is due.
