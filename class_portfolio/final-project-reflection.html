    <h1>Reflections on the final project</h1>
    <p>
      These reflections center on my experience developing my final project for
      this class, <a href='https://klp.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/project/data-viz.html'>
        Visualizating Utah's Population Growth</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Design considerations</h2>
    <h3>Clarity & simplicity</h3>
    <h3>Graph types we didn't cover in class</h3>
    <h3>Color choice</h3>
    <h2>Major challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Wrangling my own curiousity about learning the ins-and-outs of D3/Javascript
      was the biggest challenge in completing my final project.
    </p>
    <h3>Data wrangling</h3>
    <p>
      When I began my final project for the class, I ancipated some data 
      transformation needs. Having worked in data engineering previously, I've 
      used Python and SQL to process raw data into aggregate tables an untold 
      number of times. Outside of enriching the 
      <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finnegannguyen/statetostate-migration-flows-from-2010-to-2019'
      target='_blank'>US migration dataset</a>  
      with regions and divisions specified by the US Census Board, 
      I decided to perform as many data transformations as possible using 
      Javascript. This decision resulted in a few knock-on effects to how the 
      visualizations were executed under time constraints.
    </p>
    <h4>Rabbit holes</h4>
    <p>
      The seduction of learning sometimes overrides the determination to 
      stick to a brief and project goals for someone like me. My first week of
      work included enough data processing in Javascript that my only output on
      the page was a simple bar chart showing the three different types of
      migration to Utah between 2010 and 2019. Given that our class focused 
      on data visualization, I felt the need to curb my original ambition.  
    </p>
    <h4>Simplifying data to focus on visualization</h4>
    <p>
      In the final Javascript file for my project, you will still see evidence
      of me striving simplify the data to allow for visualization to be at the 
      forefront of my attention. The best existing example of this intention is 
      the creation of an array of objects used to build my first visualization:
    </p>
    <pre class='flush-left'>
    <code class='language-javascript'>
    const statesData = [
      { state: 'Utah', abbr: 'UT', percentChange: 18.4, popChange: 507731, changeCat: 'fastest' },
      { state: 'Idaho', abbr: 'ID', percentChange: 17.3, popChange: 271524, changeCat: 'fastest' },
      { state: 'Texas', abbr: 'TX', percentChange: 15.9, popChange: 3999444, changeCat: 'fastest' },
      { state: 'North Dakota', abbr: 'ND', percentChange: 15.8, popChange: 106503, changeCat: 'fastest' },
      { state: 'Neveda', abbr: 'NV', percentChange: 15,  popChange: 404063, changeCat: 'fastest' },
      { state: 'Pennsylvania', abbr: 'PA', percentChange: 2.4, popChange: 300321, changeCat: 'slowest' },
      { state: 'Illinois', abbr: 'IL', percentChange: -0.1, popChange: -19041, changeCat: 'shrinking' },
      { state: 'Mississippi', abbr: 'MS', percentChange: -0.2, popChange: -1816, changeCat: 'shrinking' },
      { state: 'West Virginia', abbr: 'WV', percentChange: -3.2, popChange: -68207, changeCat: 'shrinking' },
    ]

    <p>
      I used the 
      <a href='https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/apportionment/apportionment-2020-tableE.pdf'
      target='_blank'>
        Numeric and Percentage Changing in Resident Population
      </a> data and hardcoded it into an array of objects to avoid data 
      processing. This strategy definitely simplified data processing, but it 
      ignored the basic competency of reading data into our page using D3, a 
      competency that I wanted to demonstrate.
    </p>
    <h3>Off the wagon *again*</h3>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I couldn't help myself, and as I ingested the rawer 
      census data (<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finnegannguyen/statetostate-migration-flows-from-2010-to-2019'
      target='_blank'>link</a>) I started to process the data in Javascript again.
      The code below is likely the most succinct example of me exploring vanilla
      JS to aggregate.
    </p>
    <pre class='flush-left'>
    <code class='language-javascript'>
    const stateGroupedData = utahRawData.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
      if (accumulator[item.from]) {
        accumulator[item.from].number_of_people += item.number_of_people
      } else {
        accumulator[item.from] = {
          number_of_people: item.number_of_people,
          region: item.from_region,
          division: item.from_division
          }
        } 
        return accumulator
      }, {})
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      From a pure learning perspective, working on this anonomous function was 
      deeply satisfying. The concepts I learned and used are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Callback or higher order functions, in this case <code>reduce()</code>
          , which take other functions as an argument
        </li>
        <li>
          How <code>reduce()</code> 
          <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce'>
            WORKS</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          An accumulator pattern using Javascript, which I reused again 
          while processing the data for this project 
        </li>
      </ol>
      However, I believe I robbed a semi-significant chunk of time from my 
      visualization. I have mixed feelings about this time theft; while the 
      assessment of the project is on data visualizing, getting into some 
      vanilla JS to aid in that experience did help keep me engaged in the 
      assignment, and I found that learning enriching.

    <h2>How critiques helped shape my project</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile view ports, odd spacing, not enough data collection to substantial
      or falisble your claims.

    <h5>WERE THE ONLY WORDS THAT I KNEW FOR SURE</h5>

      It's easy to get lost when the order of magnitude is (almost) increased by
      1.
