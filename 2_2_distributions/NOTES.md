Noting the differences between having to map over a value to set a domain, 
and plotting numerical data for both axes. Honestly, it took me an hour to debug
compare commit `50b47c31b896864f897716a6a73365b86f12d323` to 
`429173933b75babb90efb12ddc01da5ab6e8c880`. Not coming as naturally as I wanted
it to.
