    <h3>Section 2 | Distributions</h3>
    <p>
      The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the age of a mother
      and the birth weight of her child. I've used size and and color to 
      represent whether or not the mother was coded as a smoker.

      For further context for this data from my source:
      <blockquote>
        The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. 
        One study, in particular, considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 
        1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San 
        Francisco East Bay area. We do not have ideal provenance for these data.
