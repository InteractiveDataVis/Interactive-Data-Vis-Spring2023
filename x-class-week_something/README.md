# Section 3 | Tutorial 1 | Quantities and Amounts

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to introduce a new file structure ("boilerplate") that will allow us to incorporate application `state`.

## Setup + Serve:

You should already have a local copy of your repository from the [tutorial 1](../1_1_getting_started/README.md). Start by getting a [basic server](../1_1_getting_started/3_BASIC_SERVER.md) up and running. This should include all the changes you've made thus far.

Once your local serve is up and reacting to code changes, you're ready to begin working on your tutorial assignment.
As you're building, don't forget you can always reference the [class code branch](https://github.com/InteractiveDataVis/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/tree/class/) or the [demo code branch](https://github.com/InteractiveDataVis/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/tree/demo/) for additional context.

## Assignment:

- [ ] Implement your own bar chart with a *different dataset* than the one used in our demo. It can be the same dataset you used in the section 2 version of this same tutorial. 
- [ ] Add axes or labels to this chart, as we learned in other tutorials of the previous section.
- [ ] Add a color scale to this chart, as we learned in other tutorials of the previous section.
- [ ] Make intentional design decisions -- colors, sizes, axes, transitions, etc. should illustrate something interesting about or relevant to your data.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Add an (entering) [transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) to the bar chart. What is the most intuitive way for these bar charts to "appear" on the screen?

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data73200Spring2023.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your committed code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
