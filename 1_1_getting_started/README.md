# Section 1 | Tutorial 1 | Getting Started

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to set up installations for your [local development environment](./1_INSTALL.md)
- to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](./2_GIT_SETUP.md)
- to learn how to [serve](./3_BASIC_SERVER.md) your pages so that you can see/interact with them while you are coding

## Assignment:

- [x] Replicate this environment on your own computer. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory in your repository (`1_1_getting_started/` [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
   1. First, confirm you have all the [installations](./1_INSTALL.md) on your machine. If you have no errors, proceed to the next step.
   2. While logged in to your github username, follow the [github workflow](./2_GIT_SETUP.md) to fork this repository into your own account.
   3. Ensure that you can [serve](./3_BASIC_SERVER.md) locally.
- [x] Using your local server, update the language in the `index.html`. Pick anything at all -- but it should be different than 'Welcome to Interactive Data Visualization Tutorials!' to show that your code changes are connected to your site. You should see this in the browser of your local serve.
- [x] Push these changes up to your forked repository. You should see your commit and any code changes in the github repo. Confirm that you see your changes in the deployed site. Follow the details outlined in the [deploy and submit below](#deploy--submit) to receive credit.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Play with the page styles using CSS
- [ ] Add additional HTML elements to the main page

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. **NOTE**: It can take up to 10 minutes for pushed up code to appear in a deployed site. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data73200Spring2023.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your committed code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
