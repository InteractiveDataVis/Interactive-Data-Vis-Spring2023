# Section 1 | Tutorial 2 | Basic HTML

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to learn what [HTML markup elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) are available to us in basic web development, including the items critical to data visualization, such as [tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) and [svgs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). 
- to get a basic understanding of [css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), and how they can be used to style a page.
- to ground ourselves in the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM).

## Assignment:

- [ ] Make your own [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) with different data, either real or made up. For full credit, this table **must**:
  - [ ] have at least one more column than the sample code.
  - [ ] include a class name that is relevant to the table AND changes something about the style of a cell, cells, row, or rows.
- [ ] Add rectangles to your svg. For reference you should use the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect) for svg rectangles.  
- [ ] Push these changes up to your forked repository. You should see your commit and any code changes in the github repo. Confirm that you see your changes in the deployed site. Follow the details outlined in the [deploy and submit below](#deploy--submit) to recieve credit.

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Add a path to your SVG. Use the [MDN documentation on paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path) to help you build a function to illustrate those paths. 
- [ ] Add an image to your page using [image tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) (`<img />`). 
- [ ] Add a [button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) or [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) to your page. 

## Deploy + Submit

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. **NOTE**: It can take up to 10 minutes for pushed up code to appear in a deployed site. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data73200Spring2023.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your committed code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Spring2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
